   	  <h4>!Hello</h4>
   	  <h5>!hello is just a basic test command for suzukaze to identify if she's working correctly or not. The reply you should get is "Hello @author".</h5>
   	  <h4>!Dice and !Flip</h4>
   	  <h5>Need to settle a dispute but have no dice or coin with you? Suzukaze Bot has both a !dice and a !flip command. As per the names say, !dice picks a random number between 1 and 6 and !flip gives you either heads or tails.</h5>
   	  <h4>!Role</h4>
   	  <h5>This command is used to add or remove a role from your profile. Just type !role and the name of the role you want and it will be added. If you already have the role, it will be removed instead of added.</h5>
   	  <h4>!Stalks</h4>
   	  <h5>Stalks are a virtual version of stocks unique to Suzukaze Bot. Similarly to stocks, stalks change in price based on a variety of hidden factors. The goal is to get as many yen(not real yen) as possile by buying and selling yen. You start of with 1 stalk and 5000Â¥. !stalk price shows the current cost of 1 stalk. !stalk portfolio tells you how many stalks and how many yen you currently have. To buy stalks, you can use the command !stalk buy and the number of stalks you want to buy. To sell stalks, do the same thing except use !stalk sell.</h5>
   	  <h4>!Exp</h4>
   	  <h5>Gain experience points based on how active you are in your discord server. Use !exp to display how many points you currently have.</h5>
   	  <h4>!Translate</h4>
   	  <h5>!Translate is a feature that can translate any language to english. All you need to do is type !translate followed by the text you want to translate (you don't need to type what language you are translating from).</h5>
   	  <h4>!Weather</h4>
   	  <h5>The !weather command tells you the weather and the temperature(In celcius) today and tommorow, so you can be prepared for anything.</h5>
   	  <h4>!Wp</h4>
   	  <h5>Lost for ideas for a story you want/need to write? !Wp gives you a random writing prompt so you can start getting some ideas flowing</h5>
   	  <h4>!Showerthought and !Til</h4>
   	  <h5>The command !showerthought gives you a random thought(from the showerthought subreddit) that makes you realise something about society. !Til is similar, but it gives you a random fact instead</h5>
   	  <h4>!8ball</h4>
   	  <h5>Do you have any burning questions you wanted to know the answer to for a while? The magical 8-ball of Suzukaze Bot has the answer to all of your yes or no questions(usually). To use the 8-ball, write !8-ball and then your question.</h5>
   	  <h4>!Rate Waifu</h4>
   	  <h5>With the !rate waifu command, you can settle the age old question of who is the best waifu. To use this command, type !rate waifu as well as the name of your waifu and Suzukaze Bot will rate him/her out of 100</h5>
