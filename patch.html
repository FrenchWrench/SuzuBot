      <h1>v0.1.1</h1>
   	  <h3>January 16th 2018</h3>
   	  <h5>This update addressed many bugs/formatting errors internally in the code, though there were a few changes on the userend to improve the experience. Without further ado, here’s the first ever suzukaze patch notes!</h5>
   	  <h4>Faster Market</h4>
   	  <h5>All stalk price have been sped up to go up and down faster. This is a temporary change to add more interesting patterns in the market, though expect to see a full rework of stalks in an upcoming patch.</h5>
   	  <h4>Tell Me the Future!</h4>
   	  <h5>`!8ball` is now a new command! Ask a yes/no question after the command, and look into the future!</h5>
   	  <h4>1 TOO MANY VANCOUVER'S</h4>
   	  <h5>Fixed bug which showed weather data for WA weather instead of BC</h5>
   	  <h4>CoUlD i GeT sOmE hElP?!/</h4>
   	  <h5>Re-did the `!help` command to link to the website as well as to make way for the new commands</h5>
   	  <h4>Is my waifu bad?</h4>
   	  <h5>Rate your waifu with `!rate waifu` plus the name of your waifu (note that this is completely random, and that your waifu is trash either way)</h5>
   	  <h5>Well, this concludes the v0.1.1 patch notes. Have a question? Got any recommendations? I’ll be updating suzukaze constantly in the following weeks, so be sure to send them to C2ke#4539!</h5>
